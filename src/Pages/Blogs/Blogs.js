        <h5>Difference between Authorization and Authentication?</h5>
        <p>
          <span class="answare-keyword">Answare:</span> Authentication means
          confirming user own identity, while authorization means granting
          access to the system. In authentication process, the identity of users
          are checked for providing the access to the system. While in
          authorization process userâ€™s authorities are checked for accessing the
          resources. So, the authentication is the process of verifying who
          someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what
          specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. Both
          Authentication and Authorization area unit utilized in respect of
          knowledge security that permits the safety on an automatic data
          system.
